          <strong>Nikah Naama</strong> is a dedicated Muslim matrimony
          platform created to connect individuals seeking a blessed and
          fulfilling union, rooted in Islamic values and traditions. In Islam,
          marriage (<em>nikah</em>) is a sacred bond, ordained by Allah and
          emphasized in the Holy Quran as one of the foundational pillars of a
          complete life.

          The Quran describes marriage as a sign of Allah’s mercy and a source
          of love and tranquility between spouses. As Allah says in&nbsp;
          <strong>Surah Ar-Rum (30:21)</strong>:
        </p>
        <br />
        <blockquote className="italic text-gray-700 border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4">
          “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates
          that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you
          affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give
          thought.”

          Our platform emphasizes the spiritual and practical significance of
          marriage, reflecting the teachings of the Quran and the Prophetic
          traditions (<em>Sunnah</em>). The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) strongly
          encouraged marriage, describing it as half of one’s faith. His own
          marriage to Khadijah (RA) is often held as a model of mutual respect,
          affection, and support. Following the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH), we
          believe in promoting marriages that are built on mutual understanding,
          kindness, and shared Islamic values.

          At <strong>Nikah Naama</strong>, you can search for profiles based
          on important criteria like marital status, caste, sect, city, and
          state. We also offer guidance in following the Islamic way of
          marriage, which begins with the{" "}
          <strong>recitation of Quranic verses</strong>, seeking Allah’s
          blessings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-justify">
          One of the key verses often recited during the <em>nikah</em> ceremony
          is from <strong>Surah An-Nisa (4:1)</strong>:
        </p>
        <br />
        <blockquote className="italic text-gray-700 border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4">
          “O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created
          from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women.
          And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs.
          Indeed, Allah is ever, over you, an Observer.”
        </blockquote>

          Prophets in Islam, including Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Prophet Ibrahim
          (AS), and others, demonstrated through their marriages how
          companionship, loyalty, and faith form the foundation of a blessed
          union. The stories of the Prophets serve as guiding examples for
          Muslims seeking to fulfill their religious and social responsibilities
          through marriage.
